![](Leastcar.png)

![](product_analysis.png)

The top 5 Car Brands From the dashboard generated approximately 90% of the total Sales transactions while the rest generated about 10%.

### Brand Insight
![](brand_model.sale.png)

-	The top 5 Brands have more than 1 Model.
-	This shows that there is a strong correlation between the Sales and Brand Model.
-	The more the models are rowed out, the tendency for more Sales/Patronage
- Just like the above observation, it is evident also that the more the models in a location, the tendency of more sales generated. 

### Date Insight
![](MSTinsight.png)

We could see the effect of the number of months on the Sales. For example, Ekiti sold for just in three(3) months, hence the low number of sales, unlike Lagos which had sales through out the year running from January - December.
## Conclusions & Recommendations
###	Optimize Branch Locations:
- Prioritize branches in high-performance areas like Lagos and consider downsizing in less profitable Location such as Ekiti.
  
### Strategic Resource Distribution:
- Ensure the availability of top brands (Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai) and at least three models per brand in every branch.
All branches should endeavor to have the top 5 brands(Reason been that 90% of sales where from it)as this may attract more customers.
- Also these Brands should be  made available all year round.
  
### Target Key Demographics:
- Focus marketing and sales efforts on the 26-35 age group, which shows the highest sales volume.

### Seasonal Sales Planning:
- Investigate the sales dip in **June** and **December** and capitalize on the surge in **July** and **August** to stabilize sales throughout the year.

### Model-Specific Marketing:
- Highlight the top-selling models (Explorer, Accord, Corolla) in promotional activities to boost sales.
- Promotional measures such as dicounts and bonaza could be introduced to bottom Brand, location in orther to boast Sales
- However, further research and investigation could be carried out to ascertain if these brands' models will be viable.
